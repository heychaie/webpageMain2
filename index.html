            <h3>Me and Gaming</h3>
            <p>Since I was a child, I've exposed myself with the wonderful world of gaming. Back then, I use to play games such as Borderlands, Call of Duty and Minecraft. Since then, gaming has become a passion that I feel very intrigued in. The game mechanics, graphics, content and design. To this day, this subject has always amazed me with new innovations and technologies such as game engines and the content of the game itself.</p>

            <h3>The Mantle of Leadership</h3>
            <p>Back in my high school, I used to be the head student of SMI IQKL. I've undergone multiple challenges and tasks along the journey up until the day of my resignation which was in late November. With the help of my fellow prefects and teachers, I have managed to generate multiple positive changes to the enviroment in the school. From first hand experience, I managed to gain the values of being a leader with charisma and exemplifying a true leader.</p>

                <h3>Anywhere beyond my home</h3>
                <p>I like to travel, and see the world with my eyes. The beauty of the world must be viewed so that we can have an understanding of our modern society. I've been to the most crowded places such as Mecca, Saudi Arabia to the edge of the world (Australia). Those trips made me view the world form a different perspective. Through these experiences also, I've managed to speak a society's native tongue. Without a doubt, if you have money to travel, then do so. get out of your comfort zone and travel.</p>

		<h3>Knowledge is Power</h3>
		<p>To this day, I've never stopped learning something new. A teacher once told me, "There is no beaty in this universe than a book in hand because, a book may contain the secrets to the universe. You just have to study it for yourself;". From that moment forward, I kept on with my "Knowledge Crusade" so that I can understand the machinations of the universe and how does God control it all. In other words, where's the thrill of it all? Well, that's an answer both you and I have to discover. </p>
